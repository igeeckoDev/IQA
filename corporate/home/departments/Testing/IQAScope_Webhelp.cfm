It would be appreciated if you could arrange an area that we could work from during the assessment. Preferably, the workspace should have UL network connections for our laptops to access UL reference materials. We will try to be flexible with respect to your staff schedules so as to minimize the impact of the visit upon operations.<br><br>

Additionally, desk audits may be conducted of data, records and/or documents prior to the on-site visit. Any issues associated with these desk audits will be covered during the on-site audit.<br><br>

The scope of this assessment includes verifying compliance to and implementation of the UL Quality Management System as detailed in the UL Global Quality Manual, 00-QA-P0001. Scope specifics are described in Attachment A.<br><br>

All Findings and Observations noted during the audit will be discussed with you during a formal closing session on <B>[EndDate]</B>.<br><br>

If you have any questions concerning the audit, please let me know. Otherwise, we look forward to working with you and your staff during our visit.<br><br>
