Jim,

I was traveling today too driving through the fields of Nebraska (not as 
exciting as Europe). 

To briefly summarize our meeting, you agreed that subcontrating is not 
necessary for hydraulic oil sampling as there are no pass/fail 
requirements that UL would need to report on. Recommendations from the oil 
test lab would be difficult to validate or support without a reference 
test sample when the oil is new. 

The best approach would be for NFPA to include pass/fail requirements or 
move the oil sampling/testing to the maintenance section of the standard.  
This will not happen, if at all, until 2012 edition. 

We discussed the wording in the report and Jim wants to meet with Keith 
and Geoff Lewis to determine how reports should describe UL's 
responsibility with hydraulic oil sampling/testing.   

With regard to breathing air sampling/testing, this is an adjunct service 
and has no bearing on reports or certificates issued.  However, since it 
is a UL service, the SOP desribing the sampling will need to be revised to 
indicate UL's position regarding results (i.e. results are provided 
directly to mfg). 

Jim C, based on the above, I am okay with reopening the CARs to look into 
this further. 

Jim V, please feel free to add comments if I overlooked anything.

Hello Guys,

Please give me the outcome of this meeting. I need to complete the report 
yesterday! Please let me know today, as I may need to reissue these 2 
CAR's, and close out this audit. Thanks.

Jim,

I propose that we meet next Wednesday morning to discuss rationale for not 
setting up subcontractors and, if subcontracting is deemed necessary, what 
is UL's responsibility regarding test results. 

I think Jim Carlisle's position is clear as stated in his email and Jim 
could pass on this meeting/telecon so as not to disrupt his vacation. I 
can let Jim know the outcome on December 1 and if he does not agree with 
the action we propose, we can schedule a telecon later in December. 

I can be available anytime Wednesday for a meeting.

Non-Conformance: 				1) There is no objective evidence that FES has addressed 
a process in its documentation, nor have FES implemented a process to 
fulfill its responsibility for determination of conformity with the 
requirements as contained in the NFPA 1911-54, para. 19.10.13. for 
hydraulic oil analysis, and, NFPA 1989- Standard on Breathing Air Quality 
for Fire and Emergency Services Protection.



Based upon the CARs, this appears as the main issue and I need more 
expansion upon it. What I need to know is does our work include 
verification of oil analysis, or not? And if not why is this not included 
(our rationale)? I would like a response next week or before then if 
possible. I will be out of the country Dec 1-5 and also traveling Dec 8-9.

Hello All, 

I will be on vacation next week, but I may also be available to discuss 
this on Wednesday depending on the time we decide. The week of Dec 1st, as 
suggested by Tom, would be more suitable though. 

Jim V, here are the 2 CAR's in question: Link Link. They are in the 
"closed awaiting verification state". 
Keith, just a small correction to a statement you made earlier, Tom 
Hillenbrand is not the Program Manager for FES according to UL's Program 
Master List. Jim Velander is the Program Manager.

Tom - I could do next Wednesday morning - after that I will be out on 
travel/medical leave for a couple of weeks (able to do some work from home 
the week of the 8th I hope). 

Jim - I think Tom's email at the bottom of this chain provides the 
requirements info you seek.  My understanding is that the CARs related to 
this issue have been closed but Jim is now questioning whether the CAR was 
effective.  I do not know the CAR numbers.

There is no urgency as this does not affect outside accreditation by IAS.  
The closed CARs will need to be reopened until this matter can be 
resolved. 
I could telecoinference Thursday at 11 am CST.  Next Wednesday morning 
works best for me. I will be back in the country next week but I have all 
day planning meetings with Hasbrook on Monday and Tuesday. 
If others are off Wednesday for an extended Thanksgiving weekend, let's 
shoot for early December.

Hello folks - 
I'll need some further information than just this e-mail chain to comment 
upon the issue being raised. For starters there is a reference here to 
proposed closure of CARs. What are the specific CAR references, Jim? 
I would also like to understand the urgency of this particular issue? Are 
there customer concerns, are the outside accreditation issues, or ????? I 
would like to know from Tom, or Jim Carlisle, or both what requirement is 
at issue? 
This will get things started. My schedule the rest of this week is filled 
with early AM sessions. So 9am would be the earliest I would be available. 
In deference to Tom's time zone and potential travel commitments would 
Wednesday or Thursday be a good day for a telecon that could be held to 
fill me in on the issues? 9am here would be 6pm for you Tom, if I 
understand correctly. I look to Keith, Tom and Jim to suggest who might 
best participate in the discussion - but I would definitely like you three 
on any call. If Wed or Thursday will not work, then next week Monday or 
Wednesday would be possibilities for me. I don't know when you are back in 
the USA, Tom, but could this wait until then? 
Thanks to all.

Keith Mowry, 

While  I would agree with you that the NFPA standard is very weak in this 
requirement, in providing guidance to third parties, regarding our 
responsibilities relative to the testing and evaluation the results, I do 
not believe that negligence gives us the right to not mitigate any risks 
on the part of UL regarding the testing, and evaluation of the test 
results of theses samples. This is a sweeping statement - please enlighten 
us (Legal and Accreditation) what we have missed regarding the attendant 
risks. 

Further to that point, I am not convinced that UL has done all we can to 
clearly exclude this activity from our scope. The NFPA standard does this 
for usAfter all, we provide the sample bottles, the sample, and the 
vehicle to mail the sample, and we direct the Fire departments where to 
send the sample. To top that off, we pay for the testing.  Merely a 
convenience pass through cost 

How can that activity indicate our exclusion of this activity from the 
standard? Also, how can the testing agency not be considered a 
subcontractor for UL.  Here is the heart of the matter.  The test lab is 
not a subcontractor since UL is not responsible for performing the testing 
- neither per the standard nor per the service UL offers.  What about the 
myriad of other services Fire Depts use for their trucks - is UL 
responsible for those too?  I am sorry, but I cannot in good conscience 
walk away from this, realizing the possible risk, again - please elaborate 
and the avoidance of addressing quality system requirements, without 
raising this to findings so we can get some resolution from the Policy 
makers for this program.  Tom Hillenbrand is the policy maker for this 
program - why isn't his explanation sufficient? 

Jim V, can you weigh in on this issue, please. Agreed - Jim V how do you 
see this?

Jim Carlisle - UL is making it clear that the hydraulic oil testing is 
OUTSIDE the scope of the service UL Is providing.  UL is neither providing 
nor subcontracting hydraulic oil testing.  How can this testing be subject 
to 17020 subcontractor requirements?  Why penalize UL for a poorly worded 
NFPA standard?

Hi Keith, 

During the internal audit with Jim Carlisle last week, Jim did not feel 
the closed CARs pertaining to sampling hydraulic oil were not effectively 
closed.  Jim feels that since we are using sample bottles, mailers, and 
are being invoiced by Analyst for hydraulic oil analysis that FES needs to 
set up Analysts as a subcontractor.  Jim offered us the opportunity to 
discuss this topic with him before he finalizes his audit report.  I am in 
Saudi Arabia and 9 hours ahead of you.  If you like, please feel free to 
discuss with Jim and let me know the outcome. Otherwise, if you and Jim 
are available this morning or later this week in the morning, I can call 
from my cell phone to discuss.  Let me know and I can sent out a meeting 
invite. 

Below are some points to help with the discussion. 

___________________________________________________________________________
___________________ 

NFPA 1911 requires a sample of the hydraulic oil to be removed from the 
reservoir and subjected to spectro-chemical analysis, particle count, 
viscosity check, and water content analysis.  As the standard does not 
have pass/fail criteria. based on discussions with you and Jeff Lewis, the 
thinking was that FES meets the requirement by drawing a sample and 
advising the customer to send the sample for analysis as indicated by the 
below statement in the FES Report.  Also below is the wording from Annex A 
indicating that service recommendations for hydraulic fluid are limited 
unless a reference analysis has been performed.  With no pass/fail 
criterial and the lack of traceability to a referenced analysis (many fire 
departments do not have specs on hydraulic fluid), we feel there is no 
need to validate results.   As a service to customers, UL has set up an 
account with Analysis where we get volume discount pricing. 
We could add verbiage to the report indicating .... "Hydraulic fluid 
recommendations from analytical test labs are limited unless a reference 
analysis has been performed on the hydraulic fluid from the fluid 
manufacturer/supplier prior to being put into the aerial hydraulic 
system.  Without a reference analysis and with the knowledge that 
hydraulic fluid suppliers and type can be readily changed by fire truck 
mechanics, UL is not in the position to verify the validity of 
recommendations by the analytical lab.  The AHJ is responsible to review 
the results and recommendations provided by Analysts or other hydraulic 
fluid analytical labs and determine the course of action." 

Some questions are: 
1. Does the current or modified report wording meet the intent of NFPA 
without the need for subcontractors?   
2. If we continue to provide a service by sending samples to Analyst and 
being invoiced, is subcontracting required even though we are not in a 
position to verify validity of test results. 
3. If we set up subcontractors, do we need to hold certificates and 
shipping of new aerials pending receipt of the hydraulic fluid report?  
Does the report need to state that the results were reviewed by UL?

Current Report Wording: 

HYDRAULIC OIL 

Following operation of the aerial device, a sample of the hydraulic fluid 
was collected from the hydraulic reservoir.  The sample was provided to 
the customer to be sent to an analytical laboratory for spectro-chemical 
analysis, particle count, viscosity check, and water content analysis. 

Annex A of NFPA 1911 

A.19.8.11 Spectrochemical analysis of the hydraulic fluid is intended 
to identify contaminants in the hydraulic system. Typically, 
the analysis will identify contaminants in parts per million 
(ppm) or by percent. Many laboratories that perform the analysis 
will provide service recommendations with their hydraulic fluid 
analysis report. In most cases, recommendations are limited, unless 
a reference analysis has been performed. The reference 
analysis is an analysis of new hydraulic fluid from the fluid 
manufacturer/supplier prior to the fluid being put into the 
aerial hydraulic system. Subsequent hydraulic fluid analyses are 
then compared to the reference analysis. By comparing the contaminant 
levels, trends can be identified and can give the analyzing 
laboratory specific service recommendations.
