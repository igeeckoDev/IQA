Subject:	Customer Complaint

Importance:	High

I know complaints was covered for China and RTP.  Did any of you have nonconformances for the NEW 
customer complaint process?

As we will most likely have one overall complaint process audit next year,  if there were no issues and 
none of you object we can consider the process covered for the year 2013 based on audits completed.

Ok?
