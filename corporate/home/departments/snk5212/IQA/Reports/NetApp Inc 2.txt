To whom it may concern,

 

NetApp, Inc. in Wichita, KS, has decided to end its participation in the UL 
CTDP and SMT programs, effective on the date of expiration of the existing lab 
recognitions, 2016-01-30.

 

Please cancel UL Project 4787050831, and cancel any planned assessments and 
related activities.

 

For future projects requiring testing, NetApp will seek to participate in the 
WMT or  TMP programs, or ship samples to UL for testing, as appropriate.

 

Thank you,

Hi John, 

Arek Salwa is the assigned Lead Auditor. 

Arek should be reaching out to you soon to discuss a mutually agreed date for 
your assessment.  I believe Arek is auditing this week.

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. 

Regards,

Thank you for making the changes. 
  
Can you tell me when we will know who the assessor(s) will be and when they

Hi John, 

I have changed the "Bill To" Account #713922 and have applied your PO# 125482. 

The below Order Acknowledgment Letter has been revised to reflect the above 
changes.  I also notated our database on future "Bill To" information. 



Thank you.
