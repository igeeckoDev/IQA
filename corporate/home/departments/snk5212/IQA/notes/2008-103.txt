Fw: Audit # 2008-103


 

Hi Chris,  I just spoke with Denise about audit # 2008-103.  She agreed with the below rationale 
(which you probably don't need) and she said "have Chris make it gone".   Please delete audit 
2008-103.    Feel free to call me if you have any questions.   Thanks!

Mel

Fw: Audit # 2008-103



 

Hi Denise,  based on Joe's email below and my discussion with Tovia, I don't think we need audit # 
2008-103.  Tovia agrees with the approach Joe recommends below.   I would audit the Security & 
Signaling section (3017B) during my Melville 'Processes and Labs' audit and audit Peter Tallman 
(he is the only 3017C staff member based in the Melville office) and provide my input to Tovia.    
Please let us know your thoughts.     Thanks, 

Mel

Re: Audit # 2008-103(1)



 

Hi Mel:

Essentially, there are two separate Sections in MEL:
1.) Karen Fine's S&S Section (3017BMEL) which handles UL (etc.) Mark Program Certification 
Evaluations (Safety/Performance of Products); and
2.) Peter Tallman's Alarm Certificate Services Section (3017CMEL) which performs Audits of 
Installed Alarm Systems at the premises of Central Office providers and their 
Consumer/Commercial customers.

These were both covered by last year's audit noted below:

2007-131-IQA - Melville, New York [Burglary Protection and Signaling]

You'll see from the scope of the audit that Tovia addressed the Alarm Certificate Services work by 
reference to document 80-CA-S0001; whereas the UL Mark Program (Karen's Section) was in 
essence handled by our traditional "UL Safety " certification and other policies/procedure 
documents.

The audit report has interesting comments about both "programs":
Positive Observations
Major efforts are under way to harmonize the records and review process for the Alarm 
certificate services group.
The S&S systems listing group is closing a massive back log and are on schedule with 
the UL-685 file review
I would recommend the S&S Section (Karen Fine's safety certification work) be handled along with 
the other "Processes and Lab" assessments; and a separate report should not be needed (even 
though only one LabOps Tech is assigned to what otherwise is a fully CAS operated Section and 
"Lab".  Karen reports to Nei Lakomiak (NBK) who reports to Jerry Stricker.
If the Alarm Certificate Services - centrally controlled in NBK by Steven A. Schmit (Peter's Boss 
who, in turn, also reports to JerryS) - are being audited by Tovia later this year, you may want to 
touch base with Peter if only from the standpoint of "local control" for the regional audits (a kind of 
Offsite Location in QRS parlance) so as to provide input to Tovia for her assessment.  A separate 
report would not be appropriate until the full assessment is conducted.

I hope I haven't confused matters.

Audit # 2008-103



 

Hi Joe,

Do you recall a specific need for a separate audit report for BP&S in past years?

Audit 2008-103 for Alarm Systems Certificate Services (formerly BP&S) was generated 
automatically (by Chris Nicastro) from last year's audit.  You mentioned there is just one lab tech 
and the oversight for the program is in NBK.  Tovia is auditing them later this year.

If there is no specific need for a separate report, could we include it in the Processes and Lab audit?  
Please let me know any input you may have and then I'll contact Denise if you think we can cover 
this under the Processes and Lab audit.

Thanks!
