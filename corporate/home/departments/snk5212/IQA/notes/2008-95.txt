Hi Chris,

Can you move audit # 2008-95 into April of 2009?  Denise wants the below 
email used as justification so I've saved it as a PDF and attached it 
below.



Thanks!!

Hi Denise and others:

The Program Plan allows frequency of internal audits (of UL and its 
sub-consultants, etc) to be set on the basis of criticality and other 
factors.  Based on the work we've completed as recently as Sept'08 on the 
2007 audit, I don't see a problem with holding off until March/April for 
the next go-around.

PS John - The Program Plan also requires that an Internal Audit Plan 
(including subs, etc.) be established annually.  Soooo, to meet contract 
requirements, at least the Internal Audit Plan (i.e. schedule as a 
minimum) should be maintained up-to-date....JoeC

Hi Guys,

I have no problem postponing the 2008 audit, until we are certain of the 
programs continuing existence.

Joe,
Do you know of any  impact to the program if we don't do a 2008 audit?  If 
the program is still around we can cover it in 2009 as early as possible.  


John & Rich, 
Thoughts?

Hi Denise,

We scheduled the New York City Transit program audit in December, mainly 
due to the likelihood that we were loosing that contract.  I just spoke 
with John Smith, the contract manager and he stated the current contract 
expires on 2-28-09.  He stated that NYC has not put out a 'Request for 
bids' yet.   He also stated they asked about extending the current 
contract with UL for an additional six months.  UL said 'Yes' be has had 
no response back from NYCT regarding the contract extention.

Joe C. audited the program last year.  John Smith stated that Joe audited 
the program at the Melville office and also at an office in Manhattan.

Do you want me to postpone the audit out until March of 2009?  Then, if 
the program ends on 2/28/09 we could delete the audit then.

With New York City running a huge deficit, it is possible that they may 
just let it go entirely ... not even put it out for bidding.

Mel,

It will be around at least until March 1, and while not a certainty that 
it will be "going away," it is a possibility.  You might want to touch 
base with Joe Chiaramonte and John Smith to discuss.

Hi Rich,

I assume the NYCT program is going away?  If so, I will delete the 
internal audit that is scheduled for December.   Thanks!
