<u class="web-subtitle">CBTL Report</u><br>
As part of a "Local Function and CBTL" audit, in addition to the internal report (either report form or uploaded file), a CBTL Report is necessary.<br><br>

Directly below the Audit Report heading on the audit details page, there will be a CBTL Report heading. If a report has already been uploaded you can view it by clicking the link. If not, click the link 'upload CBTL report'. You will be asked to select a file from your computer to upload. Please upload only PDF format files.
