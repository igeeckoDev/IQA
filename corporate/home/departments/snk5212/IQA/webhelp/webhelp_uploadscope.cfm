As part of all internal audits, a scope letter is necessary. If you are not using the Scope Letter Form, you must upload a report file in PDF format.<br><br>

In the Scope Letter section of the audit details page, If a scope has already been uploaded you can view it by clicking the link. If not, click the link 'Add Scope Letter'. You will be asked to select a file from your computer to upload. Please upload only PDF format files.
