It is preferable to communicate with CAR owners in-person, via Lync, or by telephone, followed by a confirming email. These are always preferable to only using email.<br> <ul class="arrow3"> <li class="arrow3">A quick reminder call and/or email on or prior to due dates is a good practice.</li> <li class="arrow3">For overdue or escalated CARs, a phone call plus a comment added to the CAR history are good practices. The comment will generate an email to the CAR owner.</li> </ul> <br /> Strategies for working with a CAR owner who is remote from your location<br> <ul class="arrow3"> <li class="arrow3">Consider placing a phone call to the owner to introduce yourself and let them know you will be scheduling a meeting to discuss the CAR. This is helpful for establishing initial rapport with the owner.</li> <li class="arrow3">Some work (stakeholder meetings, response development meetings, etc.) will need to be carried out remotely outside of normal business hour. This helps reduce endless email chains and needless CAR extensions.</li> <li class="arrow3">Schedule meetings with Lync, using the owner&rsquo;s schedule availability in Outlook.</li> <li class="arrow3">Ask the CAR owner their preference on how they want to work &ndash; telephone, email, Lync, real time meeting.</li> <li class="arrow3">Enlist the help of the Local Quality Manager (LQM) from the very outset to assist by providing timely answers to the CAR owner&rsquo;s general questions when you are not available. Add the LQM as Optional Recipient. This does not relieve the CAR champion from CAR responsibility, but is invaluable when owners and stakeholders need assistance and support.</li> <li class="arrow3">Keep in mind that cultural differences are key and can play a significant role during meetings. <ul class="arrow3"> <li class="arrow3">Use the LQM to clarify instructions if language is a barrier.</li> <li class="arrow3">Understanding may be enhanced in written form where each person may better interpret writing and examples.</li> </ul> </li> <li class="arrow3">For instances where the CAR response or implementation has something that is not in compliance <ul class="arrow3"> <li class="arrow3">Look for the owner (or the LQM in their absence) on Lync and discuss the issue.</li> <li class="arrow3">If they are not available, write an email explaining the finding and provide the timeframe needed for a response.</li> </ul> </li> <li class="arrow3">For new accreditor CARs with a defined due date (i.e., quick response required) <ul class="arrow3"> <li class="arrow3">If there is a time zone difference, send an email with the pertinent details and the CAR link to both the suggested owner and the LQM.</li> <li class="arrow3">Call the suggested owner, leave a message, and follow-up with an email.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
